# Overview

This project was to make the game of tic tac toe, it gives me experience and game making in a code editor.

Basically what this code does, is make the game of tic tac toe. If you don't know what tic tac toe is, its a two player game, where you go back and forth choosing a number on the board. To win you need to get three in a row of either X's or O's depending what player you are, and that includes rows/columns/and diagonal.

The purpose of this code? I like I said above, it better improves my skill in writing games in code
